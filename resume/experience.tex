{Livermore, CA} % Location
{August 2011 - Current} % Date(s)
{
  \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
    \item {Led a multi-disciplinary team of engineers to execute and delivery on a critical laboratory program. Execution included design, testing, qualification, procurement, quality, production, scheduling and budgeting as well as design and qualification of production hardware testers. The final product included mechanical housings, analog and digital circuitry and firmware.}
    \item {Lead multiple R\&D research programs developing solutions to DOE and DOD problems.}
    \item {Investigated and analyzed error correcting codes under asymmetric channel models with applications to free-space optical communication.}
    \item {Led an R\&D team investigating the use of compressed sensing for compression of telemetry data. Research included applications of dictionary learning to find optimal data representations as well as using auto-encoders for sparse feature extraction.}
    \item {Led an R\&D effort investigating jam resistant communications via modulation design focusing on lattice-based techniques.}
    \item {Analyzed and developed probabilistic models for intrusion detection problems. Performed optimization on these models to develop sensor fusion algorithms.}
    \item {Performed Monte Carlo modeling for SNR analysis of short range mid-UV communications channels.}
